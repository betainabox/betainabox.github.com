        <h3>Recipe Guide</h3>

<p>Welcome to our recipe guide, which will help you build recipes, or web site templates, that you can distribute to Beta In a Box users.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>By creating a recipe, you can tap into the Beta In a Box users market. Beta In a Box users look for easy ways to get their application started, and recipes are a great way to help them prototype quickly.</p>
<p>Plus, it's very easy!</p>

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>A recipe is basically a .zip archive which contains the web artifacts, such as stylesheets, images and HTML files, and a couple XML files that provides information about your recipe.</p>


<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Our API allows you to interact with the Beta In A Box platform.</p>
<p>The Beta In a Box API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and use HTTP response code to indicate API errors. We support cross-origin resource sharing to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application. JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.</p>
<p>For more information, view our <a href="api.html">API Guide</a>.</p>
